    "### Context:\n",
    "In the modern political landscape, social media platforms have transformed into an indispensable barometer of public opinion and a driving force in shaping electoral discourse. The X platform (formerly Twitter), in particular, is an epicenter where candidates, media, and voters interact in real-time, generating a massive flow of textual data that reflects the collective mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2024 U.S. Presidential election cycle is an event of global significance, and the ability to measure, understand, and predict public sentiment via social media is crucial for political analysts, campaign strategists, and academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: \n",
    "This Text Analysis Project aims to decode this digital pulse by applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on analyzing the Kaggle dataset titled [2024 U.S. Election Sentiment on X](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/2024-u-s-election-sentiment-on-x/data?select=train.csv) which provides an labeled corpus of posts capturing the conversation around key candidates and political parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classify and quantify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of posts directed at the main candidates and parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify patterns and trends in the polarization of the discourse over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract key topics that dominate the online electoral conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure \n",
    "To achieve these objectives, the project will be based on the analysis of the train.csv file from the dataset. This dataset is a robust source containing the post text, pre-existing sentiment labels, and rich metadata on party affiliation and engagement metrics (likes, retweets).\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology will include the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Preprocessing: Data cleaning, tokenization, and language normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of sentiment distribution and most frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Modeling: Training a classification model (e.g., based on Transformers or traditional Machine Learning) to automatically predict and validate sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final outcome will be a deep, data-driven understanding of the emotional and thematic dynamics shaping the 2024 presidential race in the digital sphere."
